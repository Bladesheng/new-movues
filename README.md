This website shows you what new movies and TV shows are airing right and which are about to be released

You can also see details of each movie.

Most of the data is pulled from TMDB API and some data is also scraped from CSDF using my [cloudflare worker](https://github.com/Bladesheng/csfd-api-proxy).

All you have to provide is your own TMDB API key.

## How to run this

- Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

- Run local dev server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
